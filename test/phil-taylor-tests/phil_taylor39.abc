N:The slurs in this tune are almost impossible to deal with
N:correctly.  Note the slur from the d in bar 8, which should
N:be drawn to the A in the first repeat bar AND to the A in
N:the second repeat bar, so we have a slur with one start and
N:two ends.  Note also the slur from the g in the first repeat
N:bar of part B.  This crosses the repeat and goes to the a2
N:at the beginning of that part.
