T:Changing Time or Key Signatures, Guitar Chords
N:From abc2ps sample file.  Guitar chords can be placed
N:over or under the staff, and should align with the note
N:symbol which follows them.  Originally written using
N:inline fields, but here edited to the abc1.6 standard.
N:I'm entirely unsure whether the bars add up here, as
N:it's not clear where the first repeat is to be repeated
N:from.  BarFly wants to repeat it from the double bar,
N:which is in a section in a different time signature
N:and generates a bar check error.
N:If the double bar is replaced with a single one the
N:repeat is back to the beginning, and all is well.
