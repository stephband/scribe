T:William and Nancy
N:From abc2mtex demo files.
N:I have moved the P:C marker up a couple of lines so that the
N:metre and default note length changes in this part follow it.
N:This should make no difference to programs which display the
N:music, but is logically necessary for player programs.  The
N:l: field is presumably a directive private to abc2mtex.
N:In any case, programs which don't understand it should ignore it.
N:Use of a T: field in the tune is unusual, but legitimate.
N:The P: field in the header controls the order in which the parts
N:should be played, in this case ABABACACA.
