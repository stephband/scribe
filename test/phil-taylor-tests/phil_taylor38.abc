S:John Davidson, National Gems for the Violin, c.1900
N:Test of some perverse uses for broken-rhythm constructs
N:The use of broken rhythms across a double-bar line is not forbidden
N:in the current version of abc, but may be in future.  The repeat
N:is in the middle of a bar, and the timing is correct.
N:Transcriber's own notes follow:
N:The anacrusis in the second part is a semiquaver, so is that in the cadenza.
N:The strange beaming in bar 2 is the way it is in the book
N:This is a strikingly unusual collection and I'd like to know who Davidson was
