% ABC Test Suite v1

% This file contains a graded series of tunes and excercises intended
% to test the conformance of abc music programs to the abc v1.6
% standard.  A few of these were written for the purpose, but most
% are taken either from the demo files which come with various
% abc programs or simply gathered from the net.  I have not always
% acknowledged the origin of these (I forgot where I got the tune
% from), so if you see a tune of yours used without due acknowledgement
% please let me know and I'll mark it or remove it as you wish.
% Each tune has at least one N: field with text describing any
% specific problems associated with the tune.
% Where I have edited a tune to bring it within the abc definition
% I have marked it so.  (e.g. editing the multiple slash timings out.)

% This file comes in three versions, with appropriate line endings
% for Unix, PC and Macintosh platforms.  The contents of the three
% files is otherwise identical, and programs should ideally handle all
% three formats.  There is a matching series of GIFs containing
% pictures of what the equivalent music should look like, and there
% will eventually be similar series of MIDI and audio files showing
% how they should sound.

% The abc standard is quite lax, in the sense that anything which is
% not expressly forbidden is permitted; so for example since the
% order of notes in chords is not specified you will find examples
% here of chords in low-to-high (LTH) order, high-to-low (HTL) and
% even random order.  All should be equally acceptable.  Essentially,
% I intend to include examples of all "reasonable" interpretations
% of the standard.  Of course there is immense scope for argument
% about what consists of a "reasonable" interpretation.

% Only abc 1.6 tunes without any of the more recent extensions are
% included, so no w: or V: fields, no inline fields or transposition
% directives are included.

% Not all features of abc are tested here.  One notable omission
% is the option of setting default metre/key/default note lengths
% etc. in the file header or in section headers.  It is not a widely
% used feature, and I am strongly of the opinion that it should
% not be used : tunes should be capable of standing alone so that
% they can be abstracted from their original files and still be
% usable.  

% This is just a start.  The real problem with writing abc programs
% and testing them is not dealing with the rules laid down in the
% abc format definition, but with the infinite number of ways in
% which they can be combined.  So, for example, the rules governing
% tuplets, broken rhythms, gracenotes and ties are all quite clear,
% but what happens if you have a note which is tied into a triplet
% containing a broken rhythm with embedded gracenotes?  It seems to
% me that the best way of handling this is to make a collection of
% real tunes which contain complex constructions.  If the abc
% developers can agree that all the tunes here represent legitimate
% abc then we can all work towards making our programs completely
% compatible with one another.  At present, none of the abc programs
% handle all the tunes here correctly, despite the fact that all of
% the tunes here are (IMHO) abc 1.6 compliant.

% You are welcome to comment on this; arguments about what does or
% does not constitute valid abc are the meat and drink of the abc
% users list, and a symptom of the health and vigour of the language.
% You are also very welcome to submit additional tunes for inclusion;
% the more comprehensive the collection here becomes, the better it
% will serve its intended purpose.

% Comments for myself, and tune submissions should be mailed to:
% aar09@dial.pipex.com
% General discussion should should be addressed to the abc users
% list:
% abcusers@listbox.com

Here's a bit of uncommented text between the tunes.  Programs
should ideally ignore it.  This is the only example of uncommented
text in this file, so if it causes problems for your program
you can comment it out.
