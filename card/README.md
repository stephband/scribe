**Scribe card**

`index.html` file has meta tags for open graph and twitter card.

They point to the player in player.html

This makes twitter and mastodon display the player in an iframe and makes
it an embedded player that can be played directly on those platforms when
`https://labs.cruncher.ch/scribe/card` URL is posted on one of these platforms.
